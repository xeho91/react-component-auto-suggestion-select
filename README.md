## Motivation

This project is a challenge I made while applying for the job position in one of the companies.
Their name is not mentioned for obvious reasons. üòâ

Also, I wanted to take this as **an opportunity to research the latest
modern open-source toolings for JavaScript**. Finally, this repository could be used as an example
reproduction code and testing case.

## Getting started

Firstly, the project uses the LTS _(Long-Term Support)_ version of [Node.js]
with the [ESM package] enabled. Also, [pnpm] package manager. If you haven't
heard about it yet,  give it a try. It was a truly enchanting experience for me
and my projects.

Secondly, [ladle] is being used as an alternative to the [Storybook]. Because it is
_very_ fast and doesn't require a complex setup, it helps develop a single or
a few React components quickly.
